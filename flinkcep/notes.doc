Events
Pause: speed< 1.852km/h 
Speed Change:Speed differentiate more than 0.25 KNOTS (Km/h==1 KNOT) 
TurnPoint: Max heading difference between successive points more than 15 degrees (vesse change its route direction)


Rules in order to avoid noise events and don’t add them at the CEP system for detecting patterns.
Noise Events are:
•	Max acceleration during a speed change > 10 degrees . Cant happen in real conditions, possible with high waves, so considered as outlier
•	Max difference in vessels heading between successive points> 60 degrees . Cant happen in real conditions, possible with high waves, so considered as outlier
•	If the spped is 55.6 =30KNOTS cant happe, outlier

Patterns:
1-> Assign: start, middle, finish


TO DO;
Remove noise events from dataset
